description: Create a range used for iterating

## Basic usage

Given a start, end, and optional step size returns a generator that will yield from start to end by step size (which defaults to one). A hat tip to Python's `range` functionality. Useful for replacing `for (let i = 0)` with `for of`. Range will return a generator that `for of` will call one step at a time, so it's safe to create large ranges.

```ts
import { range } from 'radash'

for (const i of range(0, 200, 10)) {
  console.log(i) // => 0, 10, 20, 30 ... 190, 200
}

for (const i of range(0, 5)) {
  console.log(i) // => 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```
